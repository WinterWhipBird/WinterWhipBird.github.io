<h1>NFT Beanie for Decentraland with Royalty Avoidance Protection</h1>
I am working towards creating a beanie that can be worn by avatars in Decentraland.
Each avatar will have their own beanie. The beanie will have a image on it, which will
be different for each beanier.  People can buy and sell the beanies, with a royalty 
paid on each sale to me, the original creator of the beanie.

The elements of this are shown in the diagram below.

<p><a href="https://decentraland.org/">Decentraland</a> is a metaverse that people can use via a web browser.
<a href="https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/">Wearables</a> are items of clothing that avatars can wear.
Avatars come with default wearables. People can buy or acquire other wearables for their avatar. 
Wearables that people own are linked to Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and are called 
<a href="https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/wearables/linked-wearables/">Linked Wearables</a>. </p>  


<p>Wearables in Decentraland are 3D models. TODO need to read more about this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Qd3BI6IYN4</p>

<p>
NFTs are <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721">ERC 721</a> tokens.
These tokens are each unique. The ownership of an ERC 721 token is based on which Ethereum address 
is the owner of the token in the ERC 721 contract. </p>

<p>
Decentaland allows the ERC 721 tokens to be 
hosted on a range of blockchains; for example Ethereum, Polygon, Binance. Transactions on Ethereum
tend to cost more, as it is the most popular blockchain in terms of funds. Because of this, this
is where the largest markets for NFTs are: <a href="https://opensea.io/">Open Sea</a>. Deploying
contracts and giving tokens to people would be cheaper on Polygon. TODO: Decide on Polygon or Ethereum</p>

<p>
The NFTs need to be generatable. This will mean that the bits of the NFT id will be used to generate 
the graphic. For instance, what lines and shapes to appear. The canvas from the PacMan game below
coud be used for this. That is, the web link would include the ID. The html would feed the ID into the 
Java Script, which would then generate the graphic. TODO work out how this really works!</p>

<p>Other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ERC 721 needs to include royalty API extensions. TODO: What are these extensions? How do they work?</li>
<li>Ensure the generative NFT is not deemed trivial and not copyrigtable. TODO watch the Waht the NFT 
    talk on the Ethereum Engineering Group Meetup</li>
    <li>Some NFT market places are not honoring rolayties. However, some ERC 721 contracts have bean
        written to block those market places. TODO what out what needs to be done.
    </li>
</ul> 







<h1>PAC-MAN</h1>
<p>The Pacman game is based the implementation by <a href="https://github.com/mumuy/pacman">mumuy</a>.</p>

    <li><a href="pacman/index.html">Original version</a></li>
    <li><a href="pacman-easy/index.html">Easier version. Changes: make it easier to change direction by allow for change one pixel early.</a></li>
